                <p>My name is Aditi. After this summer break, I'm going to 8th grade at <b>Cabrillo Middle School</b>, located in Ventura, California.
                I live with my parents and an older brother, who is soon to be a senior in high school. I have a few hobbies, including reading 
                and writing. My favorite book is <u>And Then There Were None</u> by Agatha Christie, a murder mystery author. I also enjoy playing and listening
                to music, as I am in my school's band program.</p>
